## General Principles 📜

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand by others. Clear and readable code reduces the time spent on debugging and maintenance.
  
- **Consistency**: Follow consistent coding patterns and conventions throughout the project. Consistency enhances readability and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's static typing to prevent errors and enhance code safety. Type annotations help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.

- **Modularity**: Encapsulate functionality into small, reusable modules. Modularity promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and facilitates testing.

## Naming Conventions 🔤

- **Variables and Functions**: Use camelCase. CamelCase provides a consistent naming convention that is easy to read and understand.

- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use PascalCase. PascalCase distinguishes classes and interfaces from variables and functions, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- **Constants**: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE differentiates constants from variables and functions, ensuring clarity and consistency.

- **File Names**: Use kebab-case for file names, matching the exported entity. Kebab-case is widely used and aligns with many file systems and version control systems.

- **Abbreviations**: Avoid using abbreviations unless they are widely recognized and understood. Clear and descriptive names enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Type Annotations 📝

- **Always annotate types where possible**: Explicitly define types for variables, function parameters, and return types. Type annotations enhance code readability and provide valuable documentation for developers.

- **Use built-in types when appropriate**: Utilize built-in types such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc., instead of their object counterparts. Built-in types are optimized for performance and readability.

- **Be specific**: Avoid using the `any` type whenever possible. Specifying precise types improves code safety and helps catch errors early in the development process.

## Function Declarations 🎯

- **Use arrow functions**: Prefer arrow function syntax over `function` keyword for concise syntax and lexical scoping. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax and lexical scoping, reducing boilerplate code.

- **Avoid side effects**: Functions should ideally be pure and not cause side effects unless necessary. Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about, leading to more predictable code.

- **Default parameters**: Utilize default parameters instead of manually checking for undefined values. Default parameters simplify function definitions and make the code more readable.

- **Docstrings**: Every function should have an accompanying docstring following industry standards. Docstrings should state what the function is supposed to do, parameters, return values, and some sample code use cases.

- **Company Test Case**: Every function should have a company test case (unit test, integration test, etc.) to ensure its correctness and reliability.

## Classes 🏗️

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Aim for classes with a single responsibility. Single responsibility classes are easier to understand, test, and maintain, promoting better code organization and reusability.

- **Constructor Initialization**: Initialize class properties within the constructor. Initializing properties in the constructor ensures that instances of the class are properly initialized and reduces the risk of undefined behavior.

- **Access Modifiers**: Use access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) to control class member visibility. Access modifiers encapsulate class members, preventing unauthorized access and promoting code safety.

- **Avoid Inheritance**: Prefer composition over inheritance whenever possible. Composition allows for greater flexibility and code reuse while minimizing the complexity associated with inheritance hierarchies.

## Imports and Exports 📦

- **Explicit Imports**: Import only what is necessary from modules. Explicit imports reduce the risk of naming collisions and make the codebase more maintainable by clearly identifying dependencies.

- **Avoid Namespace Imports**: Avoid using namespace imports as they can lead to naming collisions and make code harder to understand. Namespace imports introduce unnecessary complexity and can hinder code readability and maintainability.

- **Default Exports**: Avoid using default exports to encourage explicit imports. Default exports make it difficult to track dependencies and can lead to spaghetti code in larger projects.

## Error Handling ❗

- **Use Error Objects**: Throw instances of `Error` or its subclasses to provide detailed error information. Error objects contain valuable information about the cause of the error, facilitating debugging and troubleshooting.

- **Handle Errors Appropriately**: Catch and handle errors where appropriate to prevent unhandled exceptions. Proper error handling ensures graceful degradation and enhances the reliability of the application.

- **Avoid Swallowing Errors**: Avoid suppressing errors without appropriate handling. Swallowing errors can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues in the code.

## Comments 💬

- **Use Comments Sparingly**: Write code that is self-explanatory, minimizing the need for comments. Self-explanatory code is easier to understand and maintain, reducing the reliance on comments.

- **Comment Intent, Not Implementation**: Focus comments on explaining why something is done, not how it is done. Comments that explain the intent behind the code help developers understand the rationale and make informed decisions.

- **Update Comments**: Keep comments up-to-date with code changes to ensure accuracy. Outdated comments can mislead developers and lead to confusion, so it's essential to update them regularly.

## Testing 🧪

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all code, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

- **Mocking**: When testing functions that interact with external services (e.g., APIs), use mocks to isolate the code being tested and avoid lengthy test execution times.

- **Use Industry Standards**: Follow industry standards and best practices for testing, including arranging, acting, and asserting in test cases, to ensure reliable and maintainable tests.
